Please follow these guidelines to ensure smooth collaboration and maintain high-quality documentation and code.

### General Guidelines:
- **Write documentation** for any new feature or change you implement. This includes:
  - Updating the **README.md** if the overall workflow or instructions change.
  - Adding to the **API documentation** if the backend endpoints are modified.
  - Including relevant **UI documentation** if the user interface is updated or altered.
  - Adding **code comments** where necessary to explain the logic behind complex or non-obvious code.

- Follow the **existing coding conventions** of the project to maintain consistency.
- Ensure that all **tests** (if applicable) pass before submitting your pull request.
- Make sure to **provide meaningful commit messages** describing what was changed and why.
- **Use conventional commit messages** following the format:
  - **feat**: A new feature
  - **fix**: A bug fix
  - **docs**: Documentation only changes
  - **style**: Code style changes (e.g., formatting, missing semicolons)
  - **refactor**: Code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature
  - **perf**: Performance improvements
  - **test**: Adding or modifying tests
